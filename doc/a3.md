## 1. Bug URL:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1592623

## 2. Bug Diagnosis
The bug is an unused namespace alias declaration 'css' in: mozilla-central/layout/tables/BasicTableLayoutStrategy.cpp. 
The benifit of fixing this bug would be to maintain concise coding style and improve readability. The only risk of this fix maybe that a 
developer left the decleration there for a feature to be implemented in the future. However this is not a real concern because if and when 
that new feature is being implemented the alias could be declared again.

## 3. Proposed solution
The fix is to simply delete the unused line, make sure the alias is not used anywhere in the file and ensure corrent blank lines 
before and after. 

## 4.Test plan
The testing procedure is to manually check if the line has been removed, and then run mach build the mach run to ensure codebase correctness.
